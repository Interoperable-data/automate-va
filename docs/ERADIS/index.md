# ERADIS

We focus on the information sets in the European Railway Data register for Interoperability and Safety documents which directly relate to authorisations:

- Certification Level Documents, which can be EC Certificates or QMS Approvals, both possibly published as an Intermediate Statement.
- EC Declarations, which are covered by the above CLD's, and MUST link to them
- Safety Permissions to operate (as an IM or RU)

We further have documented how non-disclosed information (like Conditions and Limits of Use) should be handled in the KG, via the Restriction class and how the above must use IRI's to cite Interoperability Constituents, Subsystems or other legal requirements.
