## On the examples

The `/examples` folder contains `.ttl`-files of resources expected to be critical in the automated authorisation process. These examples show some important aspects of CLD, EC declarations and Vehicle Types. Only some are repeted here.

The introduction of new Vehicle Types must follow internal procedure [INS_VEA_011](../INS_VEA_011%20Registration%20in%20ERATV.pdf).

### CLD and EC Declaration

The following guidelines follow from the documentation on CLDs and EC Declarations.

- A set of certificates `era:CertificateSet` constitutes the `dct:references` of the EC Declaration supported by these CLDs.
- Where possible, the Certificate Set `dct:hasPart` links to CLD-URI's, if not a "shortened string-based" CLD must be added.
- SPARQL-query `?s dcterms:isReplacedBy+ ?p` must be able to reconstruct the historical evolution of the resource, both in the case of CLD as EC Declaration.
- An EC Declaration's end of validity date can ONLY be constructed:
  - (for all supporting certificates) through the property path `?decl dcterm:references/dct:hasPart/vpa:valid?/time:hasBeginning ?startdate` and then comparing the current date with the one calculated using the `time:hasDurationDescription`.
  - (for one specific certificate) through the path `?decl dcterms:references/dct:hasPart ?cert`, combined with `?cert vpa:valid/time:hasBeginning ?begin`, and using the same as above duration.
- Given the non-disclosed nature of some properties, the `vpa:checked` property must link to triples stored in a private graph or container.

### VA Applications

The data model confirms what is registered in ERATV: a vehicleType must be supported by a `era:VVTAuthorisation`, which is a subClassOf `vpa:Permission`. 

#### Fourth Railway Package: link with authorising entities' authorisations

Each type which was authorised under the 4th Railway Package ((EU) 2016/797, detailed in (EU)2018/545), must be linked to the authorisation case for which it was the scope:

```js
eratv:{vehicle type identifier} a era:VehicleType ;
    ...
    vpa:definesCase eva:{authorisation case identified by type id + index} , ... ;

eva:{authorisation case identified by type id + index} a era:VAAuthorisationCase ;
    vpa:permissionType era{SKOS-CS} ;
    ...
    # 4RP means the application exists
    vpa:supports eva:va-{OSSID} | eva:va-{NATIONAL AUTH ID} ; 
    ...

eva:va-{OSS_ID} | eva:va-{NATIONAL AUTH ID} a era:VAApplication ; 
    # if possible add more properties when known, using dcterms.
    vpa:requestFor eva:{OSSID} | eva:{NATIONAL AUTH} .

eva:{OSSID} a era:VAAuthorisation ;
    # other properties as colected from the Authorisation-section in ERATV
```

[Example type: 13-178-0010-8-001-001](https://eratv.era.europa.eu/Eratv/Home/View/13-178-0010-8-001-001)

#### Before the fourth Railway Package

It can generally be assumed that several information on types authorised under pre-4RP is not present. Comparing with a 4RP vehicle type:

- The Manufacturer is only identified by one Literal (string)
- The vehicle type holder: same
- The "area of use" not legally existing, authorisations were given for a membse state.
- There is no trace with OSS, as this application did not exist and all "APIS" were delivered nationally.

In this case, the above structure is reduced as follows:

```js
eratv:vt-11-057-0018-9-001 a era:VehicleType ; # Uses: era:VehicleType subClassOf vpa:Scope
    dcterms:identifier "11-057-0018-9-001";
    era:manufacturer <era-org:BEST_GUESS> ;
    ...
    # ARTIFICIALLY CREATED authorisation cases
    vpa:definesCase eva:vac-11-057-0018-9-001-1 , eva:vac-11-057-0018-9-001-2 , eva:vac-11-057-0018-9-001-3 ;

# MS 1
# Uses: era:VAAuthorisationCase subClassOf vpa:Case
eva:vac-11-057-0018-9-001-1 a era:VAAuthorisationCase ;                 
    vpa:permissionType era-skos-va:HistoricalAuthCase ;  
    era:areaOfUse <MemberState-1> ; # Always the whole memberstate
    ...
    vpa:supports [
        # blankNode as it was never physically submitted
        a vpa:Request ; 
        vpa:requestFor eva:auth-11-057-0018-9-001-1-1 ; 
        # Only the first is needed as we can find corrections by following dcterms:isReplacedBy*
    ]. 
    
eva:auth-11-057-0018-9-001-1-1 a era:VAAuthorisation ;
    # as retrieved from ERATV for older type authoristions
    dcterms:identifier "DE5920201005" ; 
    ...
```

As such, a harmonized encoding is possible.
